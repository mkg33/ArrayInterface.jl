Julia has only recently reached v1.0 and the AbstractArray interface is still
quite new. The purpose of this library is to solidify extensions to the current
AbstractArray interface which are put to use in package ecosystems like
DifferentialEquations.jl. Since these libraries are live, this package will
serve as a staging ground for ideas before they merged into Base Julia. For this
reason, no functionality is exported so that way if such functions are added
and exported in a future Base Julia there will be no issues with the upgrade.

## parent_type(x)

Returns the parent array that `x` wraps.

## can_change_size(x)

Returns `true` if the size of `T` can change, in which case operations
such as `pop!` and `popfirst!` are available for collections of type `T`.

## indices(x[, d])

Given an array `x`, this returns the indices along dimension `d`. If `x` is a tuple
of arrays then the indices corresponding to dimension `d` of all arrays in `x` are
returned. If any indices are not equal along dimension `d` an error is thrown. A
tuple may be used to specify a different dimension for each array. If `d` is not
specified then indices for visiting each index of `x` is returned.

## ismutable(x)

A trait function for whether `x` is a mutable or immutable array. Used for
dispatching to in-place and out-of-place versions of functions.

## aos_to_soa(x)

Converts an array of structs formulation to a struct of arrays.

## isstructured(x)

A trait function for whether a matrix `x` is a sparse structured matrix.

## can_setindex(x)

A trait function for whether an array `x` can use `setindex!`

## has_sparsestruct(x)

Determine whether `findstructralnz` accepts the parameter `x`

## findstructralnz(x)

Returns iterators `(I,J)` of the non-zeros in the structure of the matrix `x`.
The same as the to first two elements of `findnz(::SparseMatrixCSC)`

## fast_matrix_colors(A)

A trait function for whether `matrix_colors(A)` is a fast algorithm or a slow
(graphically-based) method.

## matrix_colors(A)

Returns an array of for the sparsity colors of a matrix type `A`. Also includes
an abstract type `ColoringAlgorithm` for `matrix_colors(A,alg::ColoringAlgorithm)`
of non-structured matrices.

## fast_scalar_indexing(A)

A trait function for whether scalar indexing is fast on a given array type.

## allowed_getindex(A,i...)

A `getindex` which is always allowed.

## allowed_setindex!(A,v,i...)

A `setindex!` which is always allowed.

## lu_instance(A)

Return an instance of the LU factorization object with the correct type
cheaply.

## issingular(A)

Return an instance of the LU factorization object with the correct type cheaply.

## safevec(v)

Is a form of `vec` which is safe for all values in vector spaces, i.e. if
is already a vector, like an AbstractVector or Number, it will return said
AbstractVector or Number.

## zeromatrix(u)

Creates the zero'd matrix version of `u`. Note that this is unique because
`similar(u,length(u),length(u))` returns a mutable type, so is not type-matching,
while `fill(zero(eltype(u)),length(u),length(u))` doesn't match the array type,
i.e. you'll get a CPU array from a GPU array. The generic fallback is
`u .* u' .* false` which works on a surprising number of types, but can be broken
with weird (recursive) broadcast overloads. For higher order tensors, this
returns the matrix linear operator type which acts on the `vec` of the array.

## restructure(x,y)

Restructures the object `y` into a shape of `x`, keeping its values intact. For
simple objects like an `Array`, this simply amounts to a reshape. However, for
more complex objects such as an `ArrayPartition`, not all of the structural
information is adequately contained in the type for standard tools to work. In
these cases, `restructure` gives a way to convert for example an `Array` into
a matching `ArrayPartition`.

## known_first(::Type{T})

If `first` of instances of type `T` are known at compile time, return that first
element. Otherwise, return `nothing`. For example, `known_first(Base.OneTo{Int})`
returns `one(Int)`.

## known_last(::Type{T})

If `last` of instances of type `T` are known at compile time, return that
last element. Otherwise, return `nothing`. For example,
`known_last(StaticArrays.SOneTo{4})` returns 4.

## known_step(::Type{T})

If `step` of instances of type `T` are known at compile time, return that step.
Otherwise, returns `nothing`. For example, `known_step(UnitRange{Int})` returns
`one(Int)`.

## is_cpu_column_major(::Type{T})

Returns `true` if instances of type `T` have a strided column-major memory layout
and support `pointer`. Returns `false` otherwise, e.g. if the array memory isn't
column-major or if it is a GPUArray. If `true`, the array should be passable to
arbitrary `C` or `Fortran` programs assuming column-major layout, such as LAPACK.

## stridelayout(::Type{T})

Returns a 3-tuple describing the strided layout of the memory of an instance of
type `T` if it is known, and returning `nothing` otherwise.
The elements of the tuple include
 - `contig`: The axis with contiguous elements. `contig == -1` indicates no axis
 is contiguous. `striderank[contig]` does not necessarilly equal `1`.
 - `batch`: If `striderank[congig] != 1`, it indicates the number of contiguous
 elements. For example, if `batch == 16`, then axis `contig` contains batches
 of 16 contiguous elements interleaved with axis `findfirst(isone.(striderank))`.
 Sentinal values of `batch == 0` and `batch == -1` indicate that
 `isone(striderank[contig])` and `contig == -1`, respectively.
 - `striderank` indicates the rank of the given stride with respect to the others.
 If for `A::T` we have `striderank[i] > striderank[j]`, then `stride(A,i) > stride(A,j)`.

## can_avx(f)

Is the function `f` whitelisted for `LoopVectorization.@avx`?

# Array Types to Handle

The following common array types are being understood and tested as part of this
development.

- Array
- Various versions of sparse arrays
- SArray
- MArray
- FieldVector
- ArrayPartition
- VectorOfArray
- DistributedArrays
- GPUArrays (CLArrays and CuArrays)
- AFArrays
- MultiScaleArrays
- LabelledArrays

## Breaking Release Notes

2.0: Changed the default of `ismutable(array::AbstractArray) = true`. We previously defaulted to
`Base.@pure ismutable(array::AbstractArray) = typeof(array).mutable`, but there are a lot of cases
where this tends to not work out in a way one would expect. For example, if you put a normal array
into an immutable struct that adds more information to it, this is considered immutable, even if
all of the `setindex!` methods work (by forwarding to the mutable array). Thus it seems safer to just
always assume mutability is standard for an array, and allow arrays to opt-out.
